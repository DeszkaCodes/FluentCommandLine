## Description
This project came to be a small wrapper for Microsoft's `System.CommandLine` package which is still in preview. The project uses **fluent-APIs*** to make interacting with the command line more readable.

The project targets .NET 7.0 and is purely written in C#.

The project is still **unfinished** so I'm unable to share much more information.
